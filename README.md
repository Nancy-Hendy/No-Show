## No-Show Appointments Dataset Analyzation

### Introduction:

    In this project, I will be analyzing a dataset that collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil
and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.
A number of characteristics about each patient are included in each row of this dataset. So, I will try to find out the
 factors that are most related to the presence/ absence of patients using this analytical project.
